ViperMonkey
===========

ViperMonkey is a VBA Emulation engine written in Python, designed to analyze
and deobfuscate malicious VBA Macros contained in Microsoft Office files
(Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Publisher, etc).

See the article "[Using VBA Emulation to Analyze Obfuscated Macros](http://decalage.info/vba_emulation)",
for real-life examples of malware deobfucation with ViperMonkey.

ViperMonkey was also demonstrated at the Black Hat Europe 2019 conference: 
see the [slides](https://decalage.info/en/bheu2019) 
and [video](https://youtu.be/l5sMPGjtKn0?list=PLH15HpR5qRsXiPOP3gxN6ultoj0rAR6Yn&t=1118) (at 18:38).

ViperMonkey was created by [Philippe Lagadec](https://github.com/decalage2) in 2015-2016, and the project
is maintained in the repository https://github.com/decalage2/ViperMonkey. 
Since November 2017, most of the development is done by [Kirk Sayre](https://github.com/kirk-sayre-work) 
and other contributors in the repository https://github.com/kirk-sayre-work/ViperMonkey. 
The main repository is synchronised regularly, but cutting edge improvements are usually
available first in Kirk's version.

**DISCLAIMER**:
- ViperMonkey is an experimental VBA Engine targeted at analyzing maldocs. It works on some but not all maldocs. 
- VBA parsing and emulation is *extremely* slow for now (see the speedup section for how to improve the speed).
- VBA Emulation is hard and complex, because of all the features of the VBA language, of Microsoft
Office applications, and all the DLLs and ActiveX objects that can be called from VBA.
- This open-source project is only developed on my scarce spare time, so do not expect
miracles. Any help from you will be very appreciated!

Download and Install:
---------------------

**Easy Install**

1. Install docker.
2. Run `docker/dockermonkey.sh MYFILE` to analyze file MYFILE.

dockermonkey.sh wil automatically pull down a preconfigured docker container, update ViperMonkey to
the latest version in the container, and then analyze MYFILE by running ViperMonkey in the
container. No other packages or configuration will need to be performed.

For information on using dockermonkey.sh run `docker/dockermonkey.sh -h`.

**Installation using PyPy (recommended)**

For performance reasons, it is highly recommended to use PyPy (5x faster), but it is
also possible to run Vipermonkey with the normal Python interpreter
(CPython) if you cannot use PyPy.

1. If PyPy is not installed on your system, see http://pypy.org/download.html and download **PyPy 2.7**. (not 3.x)
2. Check if pip is installed for pypy: run `pypy -m pip`
3. If pip is not installed yet, run `pypy -m ensurepip` on Windows, or `sudo -H pypy -m ensurepip` on Linux/Mac
4. Make sure pip is up-to-date, by running `pypy -m pip install -U pip`
5. Download the archive from the repository: https://github.com/decalage2/ViperMonkey/archive/master.zip
6. Extract it in the folder of your choice, and open a shell/cmd window in that folder.
7. Under Ubuntu install pypy-dev (sudo apt-get install pypy-dev).
8. Install dependencies by running `pypy -m pip install -U -r requirements.txt` on Windows, or `sudo -H pypy -m pip install -U -r requirements.txt` on Linux/Mac
9. Check that Vipermonkey runs without error: `pypy vmonkey.py`

**Installation using CPython**

1. Make sure you have the latest Python 2.7 installed: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. If you have both Python 2 and 3 versions installed, use `pip2` instead of `pip` in the 
   following commands, to install in Python 2 and not 3.
4. Make sure pip is up-to-date, by running `pip install -U pip`
2. Use pip to download and install vipermonkey with all its dependencies,
   by running the following command on Windows:
```
pip install -U https://github.com/decalage2/ViperMonkey/archive/master.zip
```
On Linux/Mac:
```
sudo -H pip install -U https://github.com/decalage2/ViperMonkey/archive/master.zip
```
3. Check that Vipermonkey runs without error: open a shell/cmd window
   in any directory, an simply run `vmonkey`


Usage:
------

To run ViperMonkey in a Docker container with the `-s`, `--jit`, and
`--iocs` options do:

```text
docker/dockermonkey.sh <file>
```

To parse and interpret VBA macros from a document, use the vmonkey script:

```text
vmonkey.py <file>
```

To make analysis faster (see the Speedup section), do:

```text
pypy vmonkey.py -s <file>
```

*Note:* It is recommended to always use the `-s` option. When given
 the `-s` option ViperMonkey modifies some difficult to parse Visual
 Basic language constructs so that the ViperMonkey parser can
 correctly parse the input.

If the output is too verbose and too slow, you may reduce the logging level using the
-l option:

```text
vmonkey.py -l warning <file>
```

If the sample being analyzed has long running loops that are causing
emulation to be unacceptably slow, use the `--jit` option to convert
VB loops directly to Python in a JIT fashion during emulation.

```text
vmonkey.py --jit <file>
```

*Note:* ViperMonkey's Python JIT loop conversion converts VB loops to
 Python and `evals` the generated Python code. While the Python
 conversion process is based on the parsed AST (not directly on the VB
 text) and VB data values are escaped/converted/modified to become
 valid in Python, any use of `eval` in Python potentially introduces a
 security risk. If this is a concern the `dockermonkey.sh` script can be
 used to run ViperMonkey in a sandboxed manner. `dockermonkey.sh` runs
 ViperMonkey in a fresh Docker container on each run (no file system
 modifications persist between runs) and networking is turned off in
 the Docker container.

Sometimes a malicious VBScript or Office file will generate IOCs
during execution that are not used or that ViperMonkey does not see
used. These intermediate IOCs are tracked by ViperMonkey during the
emulation process and can be reported with the `--iocs` option.

```text
vmonkey --iocs <file>
```

Note that one of the intermediate IOCs reported by ViperMonkey is
injected shell code bytes. If the sample under analysis performs
process injection directly in VB, ViperMonkey will report the injected
byte values as an intermediate IOC with the `--iocs` flag. These byte
values can then be written into a raw shell code file which can be
further analyzed with a shell code emulator.

**oletools Version**

ViperMonkey requires the most recent version of
[oletools](https://github.com/decalage2/oletools), at least v0.52.3. Make sure to either install the most recent oletools
version by running `pip install -U oletools`, or make sure
the most recent oletools install directory appears in PYTHONPATH, or
install the most recent development version of oletools using pip as described
[here](https://github.com/decalage2/oletools/wiki/Install#how-to-install-the-latest-development-version). 

**Speedup**

***pypy***

The parsing library used by default in ViperMonkey can take a long
time to parse some samples. ViperMonkey can be sped up considerably (~5
times faster) by running ViperMonkey using [pypy](https://pypy.org/)
rather than the regular Python interpreter. To use pypy do the
following:

1. Install pypy following the instructions [here](https://pypy.org/download.html).
2. Install the following Python packages. This can be done by
   downloading the .tar.gz for each package and running 'sudo pypy
   setup.py install' (note the use of pypy rather than python) for
   each package.
   1. [setuptools](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools)
   2. [colorlog](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/colorlog)
   3. [olefile](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/olefile)
   4. [prettytable](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PrettyTable)
   5. [pyparsing](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyparsing/2.2.0)

***Stripping Useless Statements***

The "-s" ViperMonkey command line option tells VipeMonkey to strip out
useless statements from the Visual Basic macro code prior to parsing
and emulation. For some maldocs this can significantly speed up
analysis.

**Emulating File Writes**

ViperMonkey emulates some file writing behavior. The SHA256 hash of
dropped files is reported in the ViperMonkey analysis results and the
actual dropped files are saved in the directory MALDOC_artifacts/,
where MALDOC is the name of the analyzed maldoc file.

ViperMonkey also searches Office 97 and Office 2007+ files for
embedded PE files. These are automatically extracted and reported as
dropped files in the MALDOC_artifacts/ directory.

**Emulating Specific VBA Functions**

By default ViperMonkey emulates maldoc behavior starting from standard
macro auto run function (like AutoOpen, Document_Open, Document_Close,
etc.). In some cases you may want to emulate the behavior starting
from a non-standard auto run function. This is supported via the -i
command line option. To emulate maldoc behavior starting from function
Foo, use the command line option '-i Foo'. To emulate behavior
starting from multiple non-standard entry points, use the command line
option '-i "Foo,Bar,Baz"' (note that the entry point function names
are comma seperated and must appear in a double quoted string).

 finer control emulation of your sample or for integration 
 into an existing project.

Please see the [API Tutorial](docs/APITutorial.md) for more information.

Generating Code Documentation:
---------------------

The ViperMonkey codebase has been documented with Doxygen (https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html)
docstrings. To generate HTML code documentation similar to JavaDoc for ViperMonkey do
the following:

1. Install Doxygen.
2. Change into the vipermonkey/ directory.
3. Run `doxygen vipermonkey_doc.doxy`.
4. Open `vipermonkey/vipermonkey_code_documentation/html/index.html` in a web browser.

This documentation include class inheritence diagrams, call graphs, caller graphs, and
function argument and return information for all functions and methods.
