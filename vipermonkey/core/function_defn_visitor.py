# === IMPORTS ================================================================

import os
import sys

# IMPORTANT: it must be possible to run vipermonkey tools directly as scripts
# in any directory without installing with pip or setup.py, for tests during
# development
# In that case, relative imports are NOT usable.
# And to enable Python 2+3 compatibility, we need to use absolute imports,
# so we add the vipermonkey parent folder to sys.path (absolute+normalized path):
_thismodule_dir = os.path.normpath(os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__)))
# print('_thismodule_dir = %r' % _thismodule_dir)
# we are in vipermonkey/core
_parent_dir = os.path.normpath(os.path.join(_thismodule_dir, '../..'))
# print('_parent_dir = %r' % _parent_dir)
if _parent_dir not in sys.path:
    sys.path.insert(0, _parent_dir)
